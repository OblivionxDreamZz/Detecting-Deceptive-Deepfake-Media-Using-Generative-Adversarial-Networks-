# Detecting-Deceptive-Deepfake-Media-Using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-


Technological advancements have revolutionized digital communication, resulting in the widespread use of social media for sharing opinions and information. However, this surge in digital interaction has also facilitated the spread of fake news and rumours, with deepfake technology emerging as a significant concern. Deepfakes, which use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create highly realistic synthetic media, especially through face-swapping in videos, can manipulate individuals' words and actions, spread false information, and damage reputations. This research aims to address these challenges by exploring the use of GANs to detect deepfakes.
The study has three primary goals: to identify the most effective architectures and techniques for detecting deepfakes, to analyse how different types of deepfakes impact GAN-based detection methods, and to develop a GAN model specifically designed to recognize deceptive deepfake content. The methodology involves compiling a diverse dataset of real and deepfake images/videos, testing different GAN architectures such as Basic GAN, Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), StyleGAN, and XceptionNet, and training these models to distinguish between genuine and fake media. The evaluation will be based on accuracy metrics such as recall, precision, ROC-AUC and F1-score. The research is implemented using Jupyter Notebook, focusing on practical demonstration and analysis. By leveraging GANs' capabilities for pattern recognition and data synthesis, the study aims to provide a robust, scalable solution to the growing issue of deepfake media, enhancing the integrity of digital information and ensuring media authenticity.
